# friction
A library containing routines for calculating the frictional response of contacting bodies.

## Work-In-Progress
This is a work in progress.  This library will eventually be a compilation of the friction modeling efforts I have undertaken as part of my everyday work.

## Available Models
- Coulomb Model
- Lu-Gre Model
